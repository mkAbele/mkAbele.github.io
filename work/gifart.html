                    <p>
                        This is my attemt on createing a gif series that ir hevely inspired by the style of haydiroket. I love the "old", jet classic interet look and feel of his work.
                    </p>

                        <img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/7b21782faad4e2ee8614949c29e5d727/3985f4a1c4521b5e-f3/s500x750/bce7b9298c4b46db265310060d3e3a73796abb03.gifv" height="500" width="500" alt="#haydiroket from TOTALLY RAD">

                    <p>
                        For example this peace is a 3D animated render that is gone thru some sort of post processing, that i like and this gives the gif a retro / 1986 vibe to it. <br> 
                        If you know something about computer history, way back before operateing systems were text based and the only way to display images were with text. Specifily ascii text.

                        For example i like the estetic of this peace, because it gives me this warm fealing of my childhood. Playing DOOM on a windows 95 pc. This estetic is something i would love to mix with ASCII post porcessing.<br>
                        But i guess enaugh chity chat, lets get to work.
                    </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h1>Let's get to work</h1>
                    <p>
                        I alread did know that this type of work will require some expertese in codeing to get finetunable results, but i didnt know that that will take that much time for me.<br>
                        So i started researching. Where will i find old windows 95 icons? I could install and fresh install of windows 95 on a virtual machine, or what not, but i actaly found a great tumblr that has just that.<br>
                        Here the link for you to enyoy. <br><br>
                        <!-- https://oldwindowsicons.tumblr.com/ -->
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ok, now that i have my icon set. I need to create some content i had this idea of makeing fun of learning processies in univerities, highscools, e.t.c.<br>
                        We all know that learning processies sometimes might feal frustrateing when you know i have finals comeing. For example you have to create new art for percivable no reason just to put it in a trash bin later.<br>
                        So i came up with a quick trashy gif/animation about just that.
                    </p><br><br>

                    <p>
                        Ok, I don't think that this is very inpactfull content wise and it didnt take much time to create. But the biggest hastle is yet to come.<br>
                        Now that i have my first gif in the half of the estetic i would like to repreduce, i needed to figure out how i would recreate this in ASCII characters.<br>
                        At first i tried some tools i found in the internet, but those gave me bad results. You could figure out whats depicted in the animation. So i started to read and read and read and ....<br>
                    </p><br><br>
                    <h1>The python's nest</h1>
                    <p>
                        So i know i needed to disasamble my source animation (it didnt matter if its a gif or an mp4) into multiple still images so i could process each image<br>
                        <img src="/assets/images/sc_1.png" height="300" width="300" ALIGN="left"> I found that this was the easyest part. Now i need to convert these pixels to ASCII, but there was i problem in this. The image needs to be grayscale.<br>
                        <img src="/assets/images/sc_2.png" height="300" width="300" ALIGN="left">Now that i grayscaled the image i could create ASCII art from it and asign characters to these grayscale pixels. The only problem i needed to solve is to color the characters in the coresponding pixel color.<br>
                        I couldnt find a fast solution that would render fast at the moment so i figured out a quick hack that worked. I converted the ASCII art to a html document and colorized with CSS and the took a screenshot of each html frame.<br>
                        That FED up my resolution, but i scaled it down. Now all i had to do is to reassemble my animation from induvidual frames. <br>
